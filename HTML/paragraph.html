    <h1>Paragraph Tag</h1>
    <p>Paragraph tags are used to define paragraphs in HTML documents. They are defined with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.</p>
    <p>Paragraphs are block-level elements, which means they will start on a new line and take up the full width of the parent element.</p>
    <p>Paragraphs are commonly used to group text content together and provide structure to the document.</p>
